# The oldest business in the world

An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the company survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this really well and last for hundreds of years.

BusinessFinancing.co.uk [researched](https://businessfinancing.co.uk/the-oldest-company-in-almost-every-country) the oldest company that is still in business in (almost) every country and compiled the results into a dataset. In this project, you'll explore that dataset to see what they found.
